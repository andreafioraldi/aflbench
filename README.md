# Readme

This is just a tool to benchmark AFL performance. Simply run benchmark.py with python 3 and you can see the scaling properties of AFL! Change `test.c` to be the test application you want it to be.

Make sure that `../AFLplusplus` contains an AFL++ checkout, with a valid `make source-only` build
